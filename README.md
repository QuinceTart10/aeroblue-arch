# AeroBlue Bootc

WIP Arch-based bootable container image with AeroThemePlasma

## Building

In order to get a running arch-bootc system you can run the following steps:
```shell
just build-containerfile # This will build the containerfile and all the dependencies you need
just generate-bootable-image # Generates a bootable image for you using bootc!
```

Then you can run the `bootable.img` as your boot disk in your preferred hypervisor.
